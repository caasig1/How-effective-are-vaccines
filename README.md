This paper contains the R project used to create the paper "How effective are vaccines?"

Abstract: Revisiting the topic of vaccine efficacy with a focus on finding any relationship between being fully-immunized and the respective mortality rates shows how easy it is to find relevant data and convince ourselves of how effective they are. In this paper, I gather data from DHS Program's survey conducted in Ghana. The survey was converted from its original pdf state into tables and an obvious relationship was found between vaccination rates and mortality rates. Many people have formed their own beliefs that vaccines do not work so, these findings work to motivate the general population to do their own research that would convince themselves of certain facts.
